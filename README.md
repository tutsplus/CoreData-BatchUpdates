### Tuts+ Tutorial: iOS 8: Core Data and Batch Updates

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

Core Data has been around for many years on OS X and it didn't take Apple long to bring it to iOS. Even though the framework doesn't get as much attention as extensions or handoff, it continues to evolve year over year, and this year, with the release of iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, is no different. Apple introduced a few new features to the Core Data framework, but the most notable are batch updates and asynchronous fetching. Developers have been asking for these features for many years and Apple finally found a way to integrate them into Core Data. In this tutorial, I will show you how batch updates work and what they mean for the Core Data framework.
